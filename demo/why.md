**Formal Education** – JCU has partnered with the Fayetteville Technical Community College and the University of Charleston, WV to award college credit for the training you receive during Special Operations Radio Operators Course. 


**State of the art gym and facilities** - In addition to the many gym facilities spread across Fort Bragg, JCU has access to its own state-of-the-art facilities which include a team of physical therapists and strength coaches.


**Peers of the highest caliber** – Everyone is selectively assigned to JCU. Each member of the team, from the admin specialists to the motor pool mechanics are assessed for their suitability in the unit.


**Extensive budget** - JCU is appropriately resourced to accomplish their assigned mission. From the communications gear to each service member's end items, you will have everything you need to get the job done.


**Special pays and allowances** - While assigned to JCU, you will receive additional pays based on your skill set and level of responsibility. You will earn $300-$400 per month in Special Duty Pay, if you are Airborne you will earn $150 per month or $225 if you are Military Free Fall, and you will also collect a annual allowance to purchase civilian clothing.


**TAD/TDY duration** - On average, you will deploy for 4 out of every 16 months. There may be additional TDY requirements that you must take part in but most are scheduled well in advance to allow for leave and family planning.


**Service component specific controlled tour** - Due to the training you receive while in JCU, we ask for an initial 4-year commitment to the organization. Most service members elect to serve that and more. If you are a Marine you can serve a total of 5 years. If you are Navy or Air Force you are allowed 2 one-year extensions for a total of 6 years. If you are in the Army, you can submit an indefinite number of extensions as long as you are showing upward progression and mobility.


**Increased promotion rates** - JCU regularly sees significantly higher promotion rates throughout the Senior NCO population then that of conventional service force.
