## About

The Joint Communications Unit (JCU) is the premiere communications organization within the Department of Defense. It is comprised of members from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Civilian personnel in a variety of communications, automation, electronics maintenance, and logistic specialties. 

JCU members are trained to be communication experts and afforded uncommon opportunities as a member of this unique team. The Joint Communications Unit is an "Airborne" unit. Since we must maintain the highest state of readiness, training encompasses much of our daily routine. Because of our deployment status, unit personnel receive a wide-range of training. This training includes: UHF and SHF satellite systems , LAN, WAN, Servers, Active Directory, Networking, VOIP, VTC, Video Distribution, fiber system installation and advanced tactical communication scenarios on various air, land, and sea platforms.
